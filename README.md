# Idea Sharing

I recently watched [Mark Yegge's TEDxUF Talk called *Executing Your Ideas*](https://youtu.be/ar9hRKYqhus) for graduate school. In the video, he talks about the importance of sharing your ideas. Mark Yegge said: "If you're not going to tell anyone your idea, then there is no way you can ever really implement it."

This has taken me a while to fully understand, but it makes perfect sense to me now, and I am glad to see others being more open with their ideas. Anytime I am a feeling bit reluctant to share my ideas, I try to remember these things:

### 1. People are lazy, they're not going to steal your idea.
Carlos Moreno told me this, he was my CTO at the time. It was very impactful. *Disclaimer: people can totally steal your idea, but generally speaking, most people have their own work anf life problems to deal with. *

### 2. You're the expert, they can't steal your idea.
A statement I continue to tell my uncle who comes up with 100 ideas a day. If you are the expert, you are the one with the ability and power to do it!

### 3. Your idea is good, but it could be better.
People are willing to help you make your idea better for free. This is just something I have noticed as I have simply asked people fro feedback. People love to give advice, and if you present your idea in an open fashion, people will give you honest and value feedback.

### 4. Telling people about an idea creates self-pressure.
The more you talk about it, the more likely you are going to actually do it. This is something I learned when Aaron Siegel made me keep a web blog in Process and Perspectives. I am a religious note taker, but don't really like blogging. That being said, this concept can work on many levels, even with your close group of friends and your personal notebook.
