# idea-sharing

I recently watched [Mark Yegge's TEDxUF Talk called 'Executing Your Ideas'](https://youtu.be/ar9hRKYqhus) for graduate school. In the video, he talks about the importance of sharing your ideas. Mark Yegge said: "If you're not going to tell anyone your idea, then there is no way you can ever really implement it."

This has taken me a while to fully understand, but it made perfect sense to me now, and I am glad to see others being more open with their ideas. Anytime I am a feeling bit reluctant to share my ideas, I try to remember these things:

1. People are lazy, they're not going to steal your idea. (stolen from Carlos, my CTO at the time)
2. You're the expert, they can't steal your idea. (A statement I continue to tell my uncle who comes up with 100 ideas a day)
3. Your idea is good, but it could be better. People are willing to help you make your idea better for free. (Something I have noticed. People love to give advice.)
4. Telling people about an idea creates self-pressure. The more you talk about it, the more likely you are going to actually do it. (Something I learning when Aaron Seagal made me keep a web blog in Process and Perspectives.)
